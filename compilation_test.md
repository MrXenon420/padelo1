# Compilation Fix for lib/main.dart

## Issue
The user reported compilation errors about missing `_showAuthRequiredDialog` method at multiple lines:
- Line 1356
- Line 1686 
- Line 1751
- Line 2061
- Line 2407

## Root Cause
The `_showAuthRequiredDialog` function was defined within the `TournamentsPage` class but was being called from other top-level functions throughout the file. This made it inaccessible to functions outside that class.

## Solution Applied
1. **Moved `_showAuthRequiredDialog` to top-level scope**: Extracted the function from within the `TournamentsPage` class and made it a top-level function accessible from anywhere in the file.

2. **Added related authentication functions**: Added the supporting functions as top-level functions:
   - `_showLoginDialog`
   - `_showSignupDialog` 
   - `_performLogin`
   - `_performSignup`
   - `_showFeatureSnackBar` (utility function)

3. **Removed duplicates**: Removed the duplicate function definitions that were previously within the `TournamentsPage` class.

## Functions Now Available at Top-Level
All these functions are now accessible from any part of the main.dart file:

- `_showAuthRequiredDialog(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref)` - Shows login required dialog
- `_showLoginDialog(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref)` - Shows login form
- `_showSignupDialog(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref)` - Shows signup form  
- `_performLogin(...)` - Handles login authentication
- `_performSignup(...)` - Handles signup authentication
- `_showFeatureSnackBar(BuildContext context, String feature)` - Shows feature notifications

## Other Functions Verified Present
The following functions were also verified to be properly defined:
- `_bookCourt` - Court booking functionality
- `_bookCoachingSession` - Coaching session booking
- `_enrollInProgram` - Training program enrollment
- `_purchaseProduct` - Marketplace purchases
- `_declineMatch` / `_confirmMatch` - Match management
- `_challengePlayers` - Player challenges

## Expected Result
The compilation error "Method not found: '_showAuthRequiredDialog'" should now be resolved since the function is properly defined and accessible throughout the file.

## File Structure
The file maintains proper structure with:
- Imports at top
- main() function
- PadeloApp and PadeloHomePage classes
- 7 page classes (HomePage, TournamentsPage, CourtsPage, TrainingPage, MarketplacePage, MatchesPage, ProfilePage)
- All utility and helper functions at the bottom as top-level functions

The app should now compile successfully for release builds.
