# Flutter Compilation Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ **getUserTournaments Method Call**
**Error:** `Too many positional arguments: 0 allowed, but 1 found`
**Fix:** Removed the `currentUser.id` parameter from `getUserTournaments()` call in providers since the method uses the current authenticated user internally.

### 2. ✅ **Class Structure Issues**
**Error:** Multiple `ref` and method access errors in page classes
**Fix:** Corrected class boundaries by:
- Adding proper closing braces for each page class after their build methods
- Moving database operation methods (`_bookCourt`, `_bookCoachingSession`, `_purchaseProduct`, etc.) outside class definitions to be top-level functions
- Removing duplicate closing braces that were causing structural issues

### 3. ✅ **Widget Helper Methods vs Database Methods**
**Before:** All methods were mixed inside classes
**After:** 
- Widget helper methods (like `_buildFilterChip`, `_buildCourtCard`) remain inside their respective classes
- Database operation methods (like `_bookCourt`, `_showAuthRequiredDialog`) are now top-level functions accessible to all classes

## Classes Fixed:
- ✅ **CourtsPage** - Class boundary corrected, `_bookCourt` moved outside
- ✅ **TrainingPage** - Class boundary corrected, `_bookCoachingSession` and `_enrollInProgram` moved outside  
- ✅ **MarketplacePage** - Class boundary corrected, `_purchaseProduct` moved outside
- ✅ **MatchesPage** - Class boundary corrected, `_declineMatch`, `_confirmMatch`, `_challengePlayers` moved outside

## Result:
All page classes are now properly structured as `ConsumerWidget` classes with:
- Correct access to `ref` parameter in build methods
- Access to top-level database operation functions
- Proper class boundaries and method organization

The app should now compile successfully with all features intact!
