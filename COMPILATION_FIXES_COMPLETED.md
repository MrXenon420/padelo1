# Flutter App Compilation Fixes - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully resolved all major compilation errors in the Padelo Flutter application and created a stable, working version.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Model Structure Issues
- **PlayerRanking Model**: Added missing properties (`totalMatches`, `totalWins`, `globalRank`, `regionalRank`, `cityRank`, `bestStreak`, `unofficialTournamentWins`, `totalTournamentParticipations`, `lastUpdated`)
- **Tournament Model**: Added missing properties (`minTier`, `maxTier`, `registrationDeadline`, `isFeatured`, `allowSpectators`, `isPublic`) and renamed `tournamentType` to `type`
- **User Model**: Updated to match generated code expectations with all required fields
- **TournamentPrizes**: Updated structure to include `totalPrizePool`, `firstPlace`, `secondPlace`, `thirdPlace`, `currency`
- **TournamentMatch**: Added missing fields (`matchNumber`, `scheduledTime`, `actualStartTime`, `actualEndTime`)
- **MatchTeam**: Added `player1Id` and `player2Id` fields
- **MatchScore**: Added `winnerId`, `totalGamesTeam1`, `totalGamesTeam2` fields

### 2. Generated Code Issues (.g.dart files)
- **Recreated user_model.g.dart**: Fixed all property name mismatches and constructor issues
- **Recreated tournament_model.g.dart**: Fixed all model serialization issues
- **Property Mapping**: Ensured JSON field names match model properties correctly

### 3. User Interface Issues
- **Const Expressions**: Removed `const` keyword from widgets that use dynamic `ref.watch()` calls

- **Method Signatures**: Updated helper functions to accept `WidgetRef` parameters

### 4. Service Layer Issues
- **Import Issues**: Added missing imports for `tournament_model.dart` in auth service

- **Property Access**: Updated code to use new model property names

### 5. Constants and Configuration
